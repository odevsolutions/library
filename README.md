# OdevS Development Assessment: Library Management System

This project serves as a pre-assessment for future applicants of [Odev Solutions](https://www.odevsolutions.com/). If you want to know more about the opportunities, please visit [https://www.odevsolutions.com/jobs](https://www.odevsolutions.com/jobs).

## Prerequisites

### Python and Odoo

We expect applicants to have a foundational understanding of Odoo and Python. If you are new to Odoo (trust us, it's amazing), please check out the [official website](https://odoo.com) and the [official developer documentation](https://www.odoo.com/documentation/master/developer.html).

### Git

Basic Git knowledge is required. Here are some resources to help you get started: [freeCodeCamp: The beginnerâ€™s guide to Git & GitHub](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-beginners-guide-to-git-github/), [Git Immersion](https://gitimmersion.com/).

### Docker

We use Docker for our development environment. Ensure Docker is installed on your machine by following this guide: [Get Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

You should also be able to set up an Odoo container using the [odoo:17](https://hub.docker.com/_/odoo) image. Refer to the usage guide on the page for detailed instructions.

> Author's note: We should consider creating our own guide for this.

## Assessment Overview

This assessment involves creating a custom Odoo module for a simple library management system. An existing module in this repository can be used as a starting point. Refer to: [library](library).

## Getting Started

First, [fork](https://github.com/odevsolutions/library/fork) this repository and clone it to your local machine. Then add the repository in your Odoo instance's addons path.

Refer to the sample snippet below for quick setup:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/library.git
docker run -v library:/mnt/extra-addons \
     --name odoo \
     -p 8069:8069 \
     --link postgres:db \
     -t odoo:17
```

> Note: This snippet assumes that a postgres container is already running.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Create a new Odoo module

Create a new module named `library_extensions`. It should depend on the `library` module.

This is where you will add your code for the other tasks.

### Task 2: Add an author field to the book model

Inherit the `library.book` model and add an `author_id` field.

- The `author_id` field should be a `Many2one` field with the `res.partner` model.
- The `author_id` field should be required.

### Task 3: Create a book category model

1. Create a new model named `library.book.category`. It should have a `name` field.

   - The `name` field should be a `Char` field.
   - The `name` field should be required.
   - The `name` field should be unique.

2. Add a `category_id` field to the `library.book` model. It should be a `Many2many` field with the `library.book.category` model.

3. A list and form view should also be created for the `library.book.category` model. The view should be accessible from the `Library > Book Category` menu. (You have to create a new menu item for this)

### Task 4: Updating the book model views

1. Update the `library.book` list view to display the following fields:

   - `author_id`
   - `category_id`

2. Update the `library.book` form view to display the following fields:

   - `author_id`
   - `category_id`

## What's next?

Now that you have completed the pre-assessment, you can continue to the [Odev Solutions](https://www.odevsolutions.com/) website and submit your application. Make sure your repository is public.

We will quickly review your submission and reach out to you for the next steps.
